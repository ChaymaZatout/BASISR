# BASISR: Blind Assistive System output device for Intelligent Scene Reading
A Simulator for scene synthesis.  
It was initially proposed in: [A Novel Output Device for visually impaired and blind people aid systems](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339213377_A_Novel_Output_Device_for_visually_impaired_and_blind_people's_aid_systems)  
  It is used for scene synthesis in: 
  [Semantic scene synthesis: application to assistive systems](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00371-021-02147-w)
## Description:
BASISR serves as an output device for visually impaired aid systems. It is perceivable by the touch sense. Its design and the 
conception allow the visually impaired aid systems to encode their outputs in several ways to respond to different applications. 
This device provides, in concise and simple way, a semantic information which permits to increase the user autonomy.
